# sampling-distribution-effects
Seeing the effect of sample size (from 1 to 30) on the sampling distribution
-> We can observe how the sample mean and variance tend to converge to the population mean and variance, respectively, as the sample size increases. As the sample size increases, the sample distribution will become more similar to the population distribution and the sample statistics (mean and variance) will be closer estimates of the population statistics.
